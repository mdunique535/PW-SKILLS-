    "\n",
    "REST Architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. REST is an architectural style that emphasizes a stateless, client-server communication model over HTTP.\n",
    "2. It utilizes standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources identified \n",
    "   by URLs (Uniform Resource Locators).\n",
    "3. RESTful APIs typically use lightweight data formats like JSON or XML for data interchange.\n",

    "SOAP Architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. SOAP is a protocol-based architectural style that uses XML (eXtensible Markup Language) for message \n",
    "   formatting and WSDL (Web Services Description Language) for service descriptions.\n",
    "2. It operates on top of various protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, or TCP, providing a standardized way for \n",
    "   applications to communicate and exchange structured information.\n",
    "3. SOAP APIs define strict message formats and often require more complex processing and overhead due \n",
    "   to XML parsing.\n",
    "4. SOAP allows for more advanced functionalities such as WS-Security (for security), WS-ReliableMessaging \n",
    "   (for reliable message delivery), and ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions.\n",

    "1. Complexity: SOAP APIs tend to be more complex and require more effort to implement and consume compared \n",

    "2. Overhead: SOAP messages can be larger and require more bandwidth due to the verbose XML format. This can \n",
